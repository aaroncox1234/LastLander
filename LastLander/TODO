PHASE 1 - Ship Control

PROBLEMS
	* Red ships eventually stop spawning
	* Player ship sometimes gets stuck inside platform
	* Framerate is inconsistent


Audio
	(from touch):     //[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] playEffect:@"pew-pew-lei.caf"];
	(from gamelay init, move to level) //[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] playBackgroundMusic:@"background-music-aac.caf"];


PHASE 2 - Momentum Based Flight and Landing

Cleanup

	Get rid of state variables and state functions from LTSShip

Taking Off

Flying

	Apply gravity inversely proportional to speed, should be zero for sufficient velocity
		This might be best implemented as a gradual rotation downwards (handle upside down appropriately)
	Apply constant deceleration to ship

Landing
	
	Create a collision info structure that stores what's been hit and information about it (e.g. surface normal)
	Push ship out of platform when in contact and in landing zone
	Apply additional deceleration when in contant with landing platform at appropriate angle
	Apply more decelartion the more leveled out the ship is (try with and without this)
    Rotate around landing point to reach zero rotation

Tuning

	Tune so the ship can grind past the landing zone and have to boost to fly again
	Should be able to grind a bit along a landing zone and take off again, or land and fly again with no state change.

Optimization

	Potential cache optimization: Store collision info data separately from entity
	Search log for "resizing TextureAtlas capacity" and adjust accordingly
 



PHASE LATER

particles 
	Landing

modes
	finish all tasks to finish level
	free mode (leaderboards)
	endless runner, sometimes with multiple ships
	leave smoke trail behind
scoring
	long boosts, near misses, collect dots, perform loops
	display score during game
	display score in fail screen
main menu

tidy
	alpha fade the warning blip

input
	gradually slow down constantly; apply gravity inversely proportional to speed
	allow ship to slide along top of platform
	decelerate ship until full stop on top of platform (ideally, ship could slip off the end but recover)
	
optimization
	broad phase collision detection
	profile for performance and leaks
	
cleanup
	pull position off of sprite. update the sprite position, but don't store position there. might be hopeless, given that sprite transforms our collision poly...
