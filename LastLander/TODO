PHASE 1 - Ship Control

blue ship
	start take off by pressing middle of screen
	land on platform at narrow angle
	ships should detect landing state. store a "canLand" if red ships should never land

game
	fail when player crashes
		create another sprite sheet for UI screens, display gentle fail screen when player ship crashes
	clean up layers (GameOverLayer, etc)
	create level 1
		3 platforms
		red ship zone
		1 player spawns from side edge of screen

Audio
	(from touch):     //[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] playEffect:@"pew-pew-lei.caf"];
	(from gamelay init, move to level) //[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] playBackgroundMusic:@"background-music-aac.caf"];




PHASE LATER


modes
	finish all tasks to finish level
	free mode (leaderboards)
	endless runner, sometimes with multiple ships
scoring
	long boosts, near misses, collect dots, perform loops
	display score during game
	display score in fail screen
main menu

input
	gradually slow down constantly; apply gravity inversely proportional to speed
	allow ship to slide along top of platform
	decelerate ship until full stop on top of platform (ideally, ship could slip off the end but recover)
	
optimization
	broad phase collision detection
	profile for performance and leaks
	
cleanup
	pull position off of sprite. update the sprite position, but don't store position there. might be hopeless, given that sprite transforms our collision poly...
